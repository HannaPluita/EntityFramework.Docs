EF Core 3.0 is currently under development and available in preview. EF Core 3.0 will bring a set of [new features](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-3.0/features) and also [breaking changes](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-3.0/breaking-changes) you should be aware of when upgrading.

Early [preview packages published to the NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore/)Â only contain [bug fixes, minor improvements, and changes we made in preparation for the 3.0 work](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.0.0+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aclosed-fixed).
